# Empirical Analysis of Ethereum L2 Optimistic Rollups

This repository contains a **research-oriented analytical study** of Ethereum **Layer-2 Optimistic Rollups**, with a focus on **Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum**.  
The project combines **on-chain data collection**, **metric extraction**, and **visual analytics** to evaluate real-world performance characteristics of these systems.

The codebase serves as the **experimental backbone** for an accompanying **PDF research report**, which presents the theoretical background, research questions, and interpretation of results.  
This repository provides the **exact implementation** used to generate the figures and quantitative findings discussed in that report.

## Scope of the Analysis

The study investigates:

- Transaction latency behavior across Optimistic Rollups  
- Distribution of transaction types and calldata usage  
- Fee dynamics relative to transaction payload size  
- Comparative maturity and trust characteristics of L2 systems  

The goal is not benchmarking in isolation, but **evidence-based evaluation** of how Optimistic Rollups behave under real network conditions.

## Project Structure (Conceptual)

- **Scripts** implement data collection, normalization, and metric computation  
- **Figures** contain the generated plots used directly in the report  
- **Metadata** captures analysis assumptions and parameters  
- **Report** contains the PDF document that explains methodology and results  

Large raw datasets, credentials, and virtual environments are intentionally excluded to ensure clarity and safety.

## Reproducing the Analysis

The analysis can be reproduced by cloning the repository, creating a Python virtual environment, installing dependencies, and executing the analysis scripts in sequence.  
Running the pipeline regenerates the datasets and figures presented in the report.

The repository is designed for **research reproducibility**, not for production deployment.

## Relation to the PDF Report

- The **PDF report** explains *why* the analysis is performed and *how* results should be interpreted.  
- This repository shows *how the results were produced*.

Figures generated by this code correspond directly to figures referenced in the report.

## Intended Use

This project is intended for:

- Academic coursework and research in blockchain systems  
- Comparative analysis of Ethereum Layer-2 scalability solutions  
- Readers seeking a data-driven perspective on Optimistic Rollups
