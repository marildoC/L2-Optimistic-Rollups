# Empirical Analysis of Ethereum Layer-2 Optimistic Rollups

This repository presents an empirical, data-driven analysis of Ethereum Layer-2 Optimistic Rollups, focusing on Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum. The study examines how optimistic rollup design choices translate into observable behavior by measuring transaction latency, finality anchoring, fee characteristics, and transaction composition using live on-chain data.

The repository contains the complete analytical implementation used to produce the results discussed in the accompanying PDF report, which provides the theoretical background, research questions, methodology, and interpretation of findings.

The analysis adopts a uniform measurement methodology across rollup systems and emphasizes reproducibility, quantitative evaluation of user-visible performance, and comparative assessment of trust and maturity characteristics.

Large raw datasets, environment files, and private credentials are intentionally excluded to maintain clarity, security, and reproducibility.

This project was developed in the context of academic coursework and research in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies at Sapienza University of Rome.
